        <p>I'm Ben, a third-year undergrad at UCSD studying Applied Mathematics, and I hope to continue studying math at the graduate level. My specific fields of interest are not fully developed, but probability and combinatorics have been interesting thus far. During my first year, I was a biology major intending to pursue medicine, but I switched for reasons that can be found <a href="writing/switching_majors/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>. </p>
        <p>I come from Portland, Oregon where I grew up playing soccer and running track but now my mine physical activity is rock climbing and occasionally hiking. Before, I could play piano decently but some years out of practice and I'm pretty bad. I'd like to regain my creative side either by relearning piano or through cooking. Although not a Christian, I am a member of a church, We The Redeemed (WTR), whose focus is on house church ministry.</p>
        <p>The classes I'm taking in the fall are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>MATH 280A — Probability Theory I</li>
            <li>MATH 216A — Math for Data Science I</li>
            <li>MATH 100A — Abstract Algebra I</li>
        </ul>
        <p>My unofficial transcript can be found <a href="imgs_and_files/transcript.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
