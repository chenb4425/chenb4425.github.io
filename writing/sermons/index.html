        <h1>Sermons I've Attended</h1>
        <p><strong>9/07/2025 @ WTR</strong> — Pastor A used today's sermon to remind the church of its purpose. This was done through two short passages (Ephesians 5:23 and Luke 19:10) and one long passage (Ezekiel 34:1-16). From Ephesians 5:23 we learn that the church is Christ's body, of which he is the head. The body must submit to the head, and Christ has the desire to "make disciples of all nations" and "save the lost." Hence the church cannot be selfish. It must spread the gospel, share its resources, and pray for others. This has been one of my favorite parts of Christianity, since I find it very touching that even if you don't want anything to do with it, the church will still extend its hands and pray for you. </p>
        <p>(However, evangelizing as a whole is still iffy for me. It's always seemed somewhat pretentious, as if saying "My god will give me the best reward, heaven, and I have to tell you because it's so much better than anything <i>you</i> believe." This is a curt oversimplification, but overall I feel it's not our right to tell others what they need.)</p> 
        <p>Moving past this though, the previous message is conveyed clearly in Ezekiel 34, where the Lord admonishes the shepherds for failing to care for his flock of sheep. The shepherds had only cared for themselves and let the sheep wander, fending for themselves. Now, the Lord himself will seek out the sheep, feed them, and rule them justly. This passage is highly relevant because WTR is a church comprised of multiple house churches, each spearheaded by a pair of shepherds—with Pastor A leading the whole church. The shepherds must tend to their sheep (house church members) with love, following the Lord's example. But, this is a bit nuanced because the leaders of the church are sources of guidance, but they also cannot lead their sheep in the opposite direction to God. That's how we get cults! </p>
        <p>But in general, it's the church's duty to open its doors and share its wealth with everyone. If the church only uses its resources to serve itself, then it is exactly the shepherds the Lord criticizes. Through prayer and fellowship, the body of Christ can grow and serve its head.</p>

        <p><strong>8/31/2025 @ PKC</strong> — Pastor H gave a great sermon, with an emphasis on Revelations 2:18-29. The general message was about <i>repenting for our sins</i>, which we can understood by examining Jesus's letter to the city of Thyatira. He writes that he is the Son of God, with eyes like fire and feet like burnished bronze, proclaiming that as the Lord, he sees all that we do and exercises his judgement. Luckily for Thyatira, Jesus had observed that its people were pretty good, as they'd been loving, faithful, in service, and patient. However, there was a woman named Jezebel falsely claiming to be a prophetess who'd been teaching the people to practice sexual immorality and to eat the food sacrificed to idols. And although Jesus had given her plenty of time to repent, she never did. Hence <i>she</i> would face punishment, but to those practicing her teachings, he gave them the opportunity to repent. For those who didn't hold to her teachings, he implored them to continue having faith until eventually, a conqueror who follows his words would rule with an iron rod and receive the morning star. 
        </p>
        <p>For us readers, it's easy to think that if we were in Thyatira, we'd ignore Jezebel's teachings. Especially nowadays, many people struggle with talking to the other gender, and few Christians are visiting Buddhist/Hindi temples to eat their food. But to understand what Jesus's letter means for <i>us</i>, we must understand the context in which it was written. Thyatira was a trade city, and many of its citizens were business people. In Thyatira, there existed <i>business guilds</i>, which were powerful networks that could make or break one's business. Thus all the people of Thyatira had to be involved in these guilds for the sake of their businesses, their comfort, and their staus. But it was in these guilds that Jezebel's teachings took place. Prostitution, cheating, and all sorts of sexual immorality were being done (think like a business frat but worse), and so it's here that Thyatira people's faiths were challenged. Could they ignore Jezebel's teachings and repent their sins at the expense of their worldly comfort?</p>
        <p>Our faith is challenged in a similar way. When you're called to act against your desire, to sacrifice your satisfaction in the eyes of the Lord, it's not so easy to follow through. We can learn from Thyatira by repenting not just for sexual immorality, but for all sin in our lives. In Jesus's eyes, there is <i>no tolerance</i> for mixing lawlessness and righteousness. In order to keep our intimacy with God, we must value our purity. Only then can we fulfill Jesus's wishes and give reason for church to be the bride of Christ.</p>
