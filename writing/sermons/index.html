        <h1>Sermons I've Attended</h1>
        <p><strong>8/31/2025 @ PKC</strong> â€” Pastor H gave a great sermon, with an emphasis on Revelations 2:18-29. The general message was about <i>repenting for our sins</i>, which we can understood by examining Jesus's letter to the city of Thyatira. He writes that he is the Son of God, with eyes like fire and feet like burnished bronze, proclaiming that as the Lord, he sees all that we do and exercises his judgement. Luckily for Thyatira, Jesus had observed that its people were pretty good, as they'd been loving, faithful, in service, and patient. However, there was a woman named Jezebel falsely claiming to be a prophetess who'd been teaching the people to practice sexual immorality and to eat the food sacrificed to idols. And although Jesus had given her plenty of time to repent, she never did. Hence <i>she</i> would face punishment, but to those practicing her teachings, he gave them the opportunity to repent. For those who didn't hold to her teachings, he implored them to continue having faith until eventually, a conqueror who follows his words would rule with an iron rod and receive the morning star.

        <p>For us readers, it's easy to think that if we were in Thyatira, we'd ignore Jezebel's teachings. Especially nowadays, many people struggle with talking to the other gender, and few Christians are visiting Buddhist/Hindi temples to eat their food. But to understand what Jesus's letter means for <i>us</i>, we must understand the context in which it was written. Thyatira was a trade city, and many of its citizens were business people. In Thyatira, there existed <i>business guilds</i>, which were powerful networks that could make or break one's business. Thus all the people of Thyatira had to be involved in these guilds for the sake of their businesses, their comfort, and their staus. But it was in these guilds that Jezebel's teachings took place. Prostitution, cheating, and all sorts of sexual immorality were being done (think like a business frat but worse), and so it's here that Thyatira people's faiths were challenged. Could they ignore Jezebel's teachings and repent their sins at the expense of their worldly comfort?</p>
        <p>It's here that people's faith is challenged. When you're called to act against your desire, to sacrifice your satisfaction in the eyes of the Lord, it's not so easy to follow through. We can learn from Thyatira by repenting not just for sexual immorality, but for all sin in our lives. In Jesus's eyes, there is <i>no tolerance</i> for mixing lawlessness and righteousness. In order to keep our intimacy with God, we must value our purity. Only then can we fulfill Jesus's wishes and give reason for church to be the bride of Christ.</p>
