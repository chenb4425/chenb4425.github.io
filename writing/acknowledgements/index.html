        <h1>Acknowledgements</h1>
        <p>First and foremost I'm most thankful to my family. To my dad for setting an amazing example and being the best role model in my life. To my mom for her dedication and sacrifice to our family, who always has my best interest in mind. And to my brother, who's been my longest friend.</p>
        <p>I'm also very much indebted to my girlfriend who keeps me in check, keeps me healthy, and fills the emptiness in my days. There's also a group of Indian fools from back home who I can always depend on to make me laugh.</p>
        <p>Grateful to NA for inviting me to WTR and introducing me to Christianity. Finally, grateful to Professor BR (linear algebra) for starting my interest in math and Professor AS (real analysis) for cultiving it.</p>
